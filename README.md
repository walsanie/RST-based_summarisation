# RST-based_summarisation
## Arabic Text Summarisation Using Rhetorical Structure Theory

This software was develop in 2005 by Waleed Alsanie to summarise Arabic texts using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). It is a rule-based extractive summarisation technique that was proposed originally by Daniel Marcu:

*Daniel Marcu (2000). The Theory and Practice of Discourse Parsing and Summarization, MIT Press.*

Some of the axioms proposed by Marcu have not been implemented though. 

The software has not been tested exhaustively. Moreover, it has not been documented in great details.  

The software is distributed under the GPL license.
